Our landing page for 2021. This is a website developed using a new open-source package to work with R and RStudio. As the project develops this page will evolve with the growth of the business to developed a complex custom website with content, information and other tools that will be valuable to our local community.

Currently, within this static website hosted on github pages we have the ability to customise the following aspects of the webpage:

- Custom background image
- Three example categories
- Social media links
- More coming...

## Additional supporting outputs

When generating small business content there are many more things to do such as logos, business cards and other assorted advertising materials.
